  Start every run by selecting one of many unique Kings. Each King commands a thematic army — from relentless undead pawns to towering iron war machines — and brings special abilities to shape the fight.

  Begin on an 8×8 chess grid. As the battle progresses, the board expands in the direction of the enemy’s advance, opening new opportunities and challenges.
